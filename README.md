From Raw Data to Risk Assessment: End-to-End Home Loan Analysis 📊

I recently completed a data science project focused on analyzing home loan approval patterns and understanding how applicant attributes influence lending decisions. The goal was to simulate a real-world financial risk assessment workflow using structured data and analytical rigor.

Key components of the project:

• Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Addressed missing values in critical features such as LoanAmount, Gender, and Credit_History to ensure data consistency and reliability.

• Feature Engineering & Scaling:
Applied One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables (Education, Marital Status, etc.) and used StandardScaler to normalize numerical features like income, improving model readiness.

• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Developed visual insights to examine relationships between credit history, applicant characteristics, and loan approval outcomes, highlighting key risk indicators used by financial institutions.

This project provided hands-on exposure to how banks and financial organizations can leverage data to streamline and support loan approval decisions.

Future Enhancements:

• Predictive Modeling:
Implementing and benchmarking machine learning models to predict loan approval probability and evaluate performance metrics.

This project strengthened my understanding of data-driven decision-making in the financial domain and laid the groundwork for more advanced modeling techniques.
